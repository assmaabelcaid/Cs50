Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Uruguay and Mexico are the teams that have been consistently wrong

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 10000 the prediction start to generate results that are both similar to a manual grading but also coherent for the successive simulations
